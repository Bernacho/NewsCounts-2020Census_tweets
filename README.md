# #2020Census tweets

This repository contains a group of notebooks that explore tweets about the census.

We compared the 2020 Census with the 2010 Census to see how the conversation has been changing through time. We also found the most active users, other hashtags and URLs that have been shared in these tweets.

In a Jupyter notebook we looked into different topics of interest in the Census conversation. This code can be easily adapted to search for other terms.
